        <p class="div_p">Below is a project I created for my Interactive Prototyping class. My group and I were
            tasked with re-designing the D2L Pulse app. We used multiple prototyping techniques throughout this
            process. For example, we started with sketches of our initial design.</p>

            <img src="Images/PulseAppSketch2.png" alt="Initial sketch of upcoming screen">
            <img src="Images/PulseAppSketch3.png" alt="Initial sketch of calendar screen">
        </div>
        <p class="div_p">After completing our initial sketches, we worked on creating paper prototypes of our
            application. The goal of this step was to have users test out our layout and navigation ideas.
            Conducting tests using our paper prototype was a crucial step in userstanding our users. Below are the
            paper screens I contributed to the project.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="div_p">After completing our paper prototype testing, I worked on creating an initial prototype in
            Figma. While
            creating this in Figma, I kept in mind our initital design concepts as well as the feedback we received
            while testing.</p>

        </div>
        </div>
        <p class="div_p">Lastly, my group created a presentation using Figma to showcase our design process as well as
            what we learned during initial user testing.</p>
